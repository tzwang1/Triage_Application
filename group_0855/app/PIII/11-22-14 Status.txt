a) What everyone accomplished since the last meeting
Added in a method to check whether a patient has been seen by a doctor, and if they have to sort them by urgency

b) What we will accomplish before the next meeting
Truman, Afsheen: Test the newly added methods and ensure they are running properly. 
Kevin: Try and make it work on the android application. 
Linda: Add in a prescription class

c) Any problems preventing progress?
Prescription class added in late - still deciding on whether we should make it a class or just add it as a new variable to the Patient class
